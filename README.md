Overview
--------
"Asteroids Reimagined" is a contemporary adaptation of the iconic 1979 arcade classic, rebuilt using Python 3.12 and Raylib 5.50. 
This project retains the core mechanics of dodging and destroying asteroids while introducing fresh gameplay elements, enhanced visuals, 
and modernized controls. Designed for both nostalgia enthusiasts and new players, it showcases the flexibility of Python and Raylib in 
2D game development.
